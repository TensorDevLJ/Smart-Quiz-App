SmartQuiz - Java Swing + SQLite (Maven)
=====================================

This is a simple online-quiz desktop application built with Java Swing and SQLite (via JDBC).
It uses Maven. The project includes an Admin panel (to add questions) and a User quiz UI.

Default admin credentials: username=admin password=admin

How to run:
1. Make sure you have Java 17+ and Maven installed.
2. Unzip this project (smartquiz.zip) or open the folder in VS Code.
3. From the project root (where pom.xml is), run:
   mvn clean package
   This will create a runnable jar with dependencies: target/smartquiz-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
4. Run:
   java -jar target/smartquiz-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
5. First run will create quiz_app.db in the project root and create tables.
6. Use Admin panel to add questions, then register/login as a user to take a quiz.

Notes:
- Passwords are stored in plain text in this simple demo. For production, hash passwords.
- You can edit number of questions by changing fetchRandomQuestions(5) in UserPanel.
- If you prefer running from VS Code, import as a Maven project and run Main.java
